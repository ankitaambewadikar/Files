    "description": "The secret behind LG TV’s life-like color and wide viewing angle is the panel. Just as the quality of the beans determines the quality of the coffee, the quality of the panel determines the quality of the TV. The IPS Panel used by LG is the reason why LG LED TVs have clearer, more consistent, and sturdy screens. Life-like Color: IPS offers a color impression that is most identical to that of the original image. The colors are truly closest to nature and most comfortable for the eyes. Wide Viewing Angle: Among LCD panels, it is visibly clear that IPS shows the most consistent color and contrast from all angles. Free from color wash and contrast loss, it is the ideal panel for all purposes.",
