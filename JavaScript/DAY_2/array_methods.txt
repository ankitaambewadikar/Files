ARRAY METHODS:

1) Converting Arrays to String-The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of array values.

code:
var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"];
console.log(fruits.toString());

2) Poping -The pop() method removes the last element from an array

code:
var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","mango"];
console.log(fruits.pop());
console.log(fruits);

3) Pushing-The push() method adds a new element to an array (at the end)
code:
var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","mango"];
fruits.push("orange");
console.log(fruits);

4) Splicing an Array- The splice() method can be used to add new items to an array

code:
var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","mango"];
fruits.splice(2,0,"lemon","grapes");
console.log(fruits);
5) Merging Arrays- The concat() method creates new array by merging existing arrays.

code:
var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","mango"];
var numbers = [1,2,3];
var newArr = fruits.concat(numbers);
console.log(newArr);

6) Searching in array : (indexOf,lastIndexOf,includes)

arr.indexOf(item, from) looks for item starting from index from, and returns the index where it was found, otherwise -1.
arr.lastIndexOf(item, from) – same, but looks from right to left.
arr.includes(item, from) – looks for item starting from index from, returns true if found.

code:

7) Shifting Array elements -Shifting is equivalent to popping, working on the first element instead of the last.
			The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

code:
  var fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry","mango"];
  fruits.shift();
  console.log(fruits);

8) Changing elements-Array elements are accessed using their index number

code:
 var num = [23,78,50,2,1];
  num[num.length] = 100;
  console.log(num);

9)Transform an Array- arr.map()-methods transforming or reordering the array.

It calls the function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.
 here we transform each element into its length
code:
  var lengths = ["Bilbo", "Gandalf", "Nazgul"].map(item => item.length)
console.log(lengths);

10)Reverse- arr.reverse() method reverses the order of elements in arr.

code:
var num = [23,78,50,2,1];
num.reverse();
console.log(num);

11) join
